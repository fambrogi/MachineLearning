The principle behind the algorithm is this:
The split is computed on the attribute that has the biggest standard deviation reduction
I compute it on every attribute in the dataset.
In order to get it consider An attribute at a time and split the dataset according to the average value of the elements
in the attribute column.
 the steps are:
 - for every attribute:
    -compute the avg of dataset[attribute]
    -split the dataset according to: dataset[attribute]<avg
    -on those splits compute the standard deviation of the split
 -I choose the split attribute according the biggest standard deviation reduction
